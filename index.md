# Welcome to builderscon

builderscon is a "festival (お祭り)" for geeks who are passionate about technology.

It's about passion for tech, a conference for all the people who love tech. builderscon grew out of a massively successful community driven polyglot event known as "YAPC::Asia Tokyo" which ran between 2006 and 2015.

We are planning the first instance to be held on **December 2016**
