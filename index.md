<h1>Welcome to builderscon</h1>

<p>builderscon is a "festival (お祭り)" for geeks who are passionate about technology.</p>

<p>It's about passion for tech, a conference for all the people who love tech. builderscon grew out of a massively successful community driven polyglot event known as "YAPC::Asia Tokyo" which ran between 2006 and 2015.</p>

<p>We are planning the first instance to be held on <b>December 2016</b></p>
